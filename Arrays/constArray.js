//array references 

//when we do this,
let arr = [12,34,32] //now arr stores the reference to the arrayÂ 
//in this case,
let arrCopy = arr ; //now, arrCopy will store the reference to arr array, abb agar hum koi bhi changes karenge arrCopy me changes 

//constant arrays 
//we can made changes to the elements of array and can add or delete elements but we cannot change the whole array
const array = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8];
//like,
array = [8,9,10,11,12,13,14] //here we are assigning array to new Array and it will give us error

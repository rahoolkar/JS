//api - application programming interface, it is mainly used to interact between 2 softwares 
//we send request to a server api and then the api accepts the request and then gives some data related to the request in the form of response
//the response is in a diffrent format and we call it as a json 

//api are the link(endpoint), jispar hum kuch request bhejenge and then we recieve some data in the form of response and in the format of json 

//json stands for javascript object notation

//methods with json
//1. JSON.parse(data) -> convert json string data into js object
//2. JSON.stringify(json) -> convert js object into json data

//api request testing tools

//Ajax is asynchronous javascript and xml, means the process of client sending request to the api and then api sending the response is a asynchronous, api ekdum se data laa kar nhi dega it may take some time to return the data 
//jab bhio ajax ki baat ho rahi hai iska matlab yahi hai ki hum(client) apis ko call kar rahi hai and yeh calls asynchronously work karti hai
